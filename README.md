 **Analyze how education opportunities and international flows differ across countries by focusing on the following**
- Patterns and differences by region
- How common high/low values are globally 
- The relationship between sending and receiving 

- Access to higher education
- Opportunity and inequality
- Globalization and “where talent goes”
- Whether a country is an education destination (attracts students) or a sender (students leave)
